git training notes

mkdir <dir name>
git init	//initialises the new rep
to check if it is a git directory type ll (ls -al). if it contains .git thats it. the dot before git means that it is a hidden directory
also git status will confirm the same
i should always use git status or as often as possible

git add - A .	//adds all files
if a wrong file eg file called wrong was added by mistake you can type
git reset wrong
the
rm wrong	//will remove that file
